Everything in computer is just a files. everything is devided in files.

File can represent many thing in different formats.

Hard Drive = [010010101010101010101010] [1010101010010101010] [1010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010010101010]

                      this peace of binary data on hard drive represents a file

file itself has some data called as FILE DATA.
File Data:
          - ame (just name of the file)
          - Protection (write/read/access)
          - Location (just a pathname)
          - Type (based on file type it means how we can open a file, how to decode a file. for openin/decoding the file we need different applications)
          - Timestamps (creation of file, modified ...)

Every program/application is a file
and OS can only execute executebal files
